//Diffrenetiate b/w error and exception with example.
An error typically refers to a serious issue that cannot be handled or recovered from, often caused by external factors like memory issues or resource unavailability. Errors are typically outside the control of the
programmer and often represent conditions that should not occur during normal program execution.
Examples of Errors:
Out of Memory Error (Java: OutOfMemoryError): Occurs when the JVM runs out of memory.
Stack Overflow Error: Caused by excessive recursion, leading to a stack overflow.

An exception is a condition that occurs during the execution of a program and that can often be anticipated and handled by the 
programmer. Exceptions can be caused by many factors, such as invalid user input, trying to open a file that doesn't exist, etc.
Examples of Exceptions:
NullPointerException (Java): Occurs when a program tries to use a null object reference.
FileNotFoundException (Java): Occurs when a program tries to access a file that doesn't exist.

//Describe the control flow in try ,catch ,finally block.What happen if exception is thrown in try and catch block both?
try block:
This is where you place the code that may throw an exception.
If an exception occurs, the rest of the code in the try block is skipped, and control is 
transferred to the corresponding catch block (if one is present).
If no exception occurs, the catch block is skipped, and control moves to the finally block (if it exists).

catch block:
If an exception occurs in the try block, the program will jump to the catch block.
The catch block is used to handle specific exceptions (e.g., catch (IOException e)).
If the exception matches the type declared in the catch block, the exception is handled inside it.
After handling the exception, control moves to the finally block (if it exists).

finally block:
This block will always execute, whether an exception occurred or not.
It is typically used for cleanup actions, like closing files, releasing resources, or disconnecting from a database.
The finally block runs regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not, and it will 
run even if an exception is caught and handled in the catch block.
If a return statement is encountered inside the try or catch blocks, the finally block will still 
execute before the method actually returns.

If an exception is thrown in the try block:
The control will jump to the corresponding catch block (if the exception is of a type that the catch block can handle).
If the catch block doesn't handle the exception properly (or throws another exception), then the program will attempt to handle 
it again in the next available catch or propagate it further.

If an exception is thrown in the catch block:
If an exception occurs in the catch block while handling another exception, the exception from the catch block will propagate. 
The finally block will still execute before the exception propagates out of the catch block.
This can lead to exception chaining, where one exception is caught and then another exception is thrown from the catch block.

//What are user difined exception and how they are used in java?
n Java, exceptions are used to handle errors and exceptional conditions in programs. While Java provides many built-in exceptions 
(like NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, etc.), sometimes you might need to define your own exception to represent 
specific error conditions in your application. These are called User-Defined Exceptions.

A User-Defined Exception is an exception that is created by the programmer to handle specific situations in the code. 
Java allows you to create custom exceptions by extending the built-in Exception class (or its subclasses).

Steps to Create a User-Defined Exception:
Create the exception class: Extend Exception or RuntimeException.
Throw the exception: Use the throw keyword to explicitly throw your custom exception when a specific condition is met.
Catch the exception: Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle the custom exception.

//Write a program that handle both checked (i/o) unchecked (airthematic) exception in the same try catch block.
import java.io.*;
public class MixedExceptionHandling {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;
            FileReader file = new FileReader("nonexistent_file.txt");
            BufferedReader fileReader = new BufferedReader(file);
            String line = fileReader.readLine();
            System.out.println(line);
        } catch (IOException | ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getClass().getSimpleName());
            System.out.println("Error Message: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block executed!");
        }
    }
}
